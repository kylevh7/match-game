Match Game
Written by Kyle VanHaitsma

The purpose of the game is to try and match all cards in the game area. 

There is a 3:00 minute timer, the players moves are tracked above the game board and the player
rating will fall from 3 stars down to one as the moves continue to increase. Eventually, if the 
moves reach an upper limit the game will end and ask the player to restart. 

This game is compatible with most modern devices with a web browser.
